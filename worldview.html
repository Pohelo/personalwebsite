<div id="worldviewoverview"><p>"I have a worldview that is not so much different from other students or teachers at Logos International School, as I believe. This is because I am also Christian. However, there might be some differences too. This is because of my nationality differing from many other poeple. As I am Korean, I might have a different worldview as Americans in our school. However, I personally believe that this worldview doesn't matter a lot, as Bible said we are all sons and daughters of God."</p></div>
