<div id="header"><h3>Some of my Interests</h3></div>
      <div id="picture"><img src="hobby.jpg"></img></div>
<div id="Interest1"><p>I had lots of hobbies and interests when I was young. The first of the many was collecting stamps. I collected more than 500 different stamps from different countries, such as Great Britain, Sri Lanka, the United States, Korea, Maldives etc. However, due to my mum, who threw away all the stamps when I was not at home, this became no more my hobby.</p></div>
<div id="Interest2"><p>Not only that, but I was collecting coins from different countries too. I have collected German (not Euro), Netherlands, Hong Kong, Japanese, and some paper money which is no more used. This is, again, not my hobby anymore, due to my mum who took all my coins. I can call myself an "expert" in Origami. I have learned it since kindergarten and I still remember all sorts of things. It is fun and I still fold some, when I need relaxation.</p></div>
<div id="Interest3"><p>I also had different sports as my hobby. For example tennis. Tennis is not my favourite sport, but, because I started it, I tried my best. However, this didn't last long. Football (US:Soccer) is my favourite sport, which I love to play and I love to watch. As I am busy studying these days, I couldn't play football for a long time. </p></div>
<div id="Interest4"><p>I can play many instruments, but not all are good. I learned to play piano long time ago. I learned to play guitar, and recorder (and xylophone if you consider it as an instrument). Recently, I learned to play kazoo myself, which was not that hard. I am still learning harmonica myself. The instrument I can play the best is flute.</p></div>

      <div id="MusicTitle">My Music Title: 아무 이유 없이 그냥 (Without reason, Just)</div>
      <br> <div id="Music"><audio controls><source src="Just.mp3" type="audio/MP3"></audio></div>
<div id="Interest5"><p>There is one hobby that I have been introduced by my childhood friend. It was composing music. I first started composing in music class at ISPP, I was told by my teacher and my friends that I was quite good at it. I didn't think of that as my hobby until my childhood friend told me. I started it, using noteflight. And now I am using garageband which is quite harder to use, but much more efficient. I have been uploading my short musics on internet, and currently I have about 19 followers. (The maximum I had was about 30, but becasue I didn't visit the site and compose often my followers unfollowed me). I used to compose classic/piano songs, but because of my friend's recommendation, I am trying new genre of electronic(?). It is the most exciting I've ever did in my life.</p></div>
<div id="ToCareerAspiration"><p>Because my parents don't like me collecting stamps or coins, and they have confidence (and I too have confidence) that I am not a great sportsman, and my parents don't accept me as composer, my interests and hobbies do not affect my vision (career aspiration). Then what is it? Click the menu above to see what my dream is. Or, you can visit my worldview page first!</p></div>
