<div id="intro"><p>My dream changed often in my childhood and as I grew older, the frequency of change became little.
It was when I was about 14 years old when I was learning algebra or algebra 2. That time my dream was to become an architect like my father.
I didn't know how to solve the problem so I asked my father. My father kept teaching me and, for some reason, I didn't get what he was teaching me.
My father has never shouted as long as I remember and he never scolded me. But for the first and the last time, he scolded me and shouted at me.
I was so scared of that and that day Algebra became my worst area in math because I never studied algebra after that. Math also became one of my most hated subjects.
It was like truama and this made myself think I am dumb, and I should choose a career that is least related to math while I like it.</p></div>
<br><div id="MyCareer"><p>I thought and thought and thought about my career and this took me for year or more. The answer I got finally was to become business-man, which is also called as the CEO.
At beginning, my parents didn't accept my idea. They said it would be hard to live, especially if I start my own business, which was what I was planning to do.
As months flew and I still did not change my mind, my parents started to accept my idea. When I was coming up with what I wanted to become, several things influenced me to choose CEO, which is a secret for now. Working in UK, is also one of my dreams. </p></div>
